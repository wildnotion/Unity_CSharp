Unity Prototyping Code

For quick prototyping in Unity, I will be adding some code in this repository.

PlayerMove2D: Allows 2D movement for a player. Attach this script to a Game Object with a Tag "Player" that also has an attached Rigidbody 2D component and a Sprite Renderer component.

FollowPlayerCamera: Follows the player with the camera. Attach this script to the camera, and ensure there is a game object with the Tag "Player".
